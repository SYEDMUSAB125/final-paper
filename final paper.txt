Q1:You are given an array of objects representing users:
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 25 },
  { id: 2, name: "Bob", age: 30 },
  { id: 3, name: "Charlie", age: 35 },
  { id: 4, name: "David", age: 22 }
];
Write a function getAdultUserNames that returns an array of names of users who are 30 years or older.

Question 2: Async API Fetching
You need to fetch a list of posts from a public API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and log the titles of the posts that contain the word "est" in them.

Write an async function fetchAndLogPosts that does the following:
1)Fetches the posts from the API.
2)Logs the titles of those posts to the console.

3)Write a function swapValues that takes two variables, a and b, and swaps their values. Return the swapped values as an array.

4)Create a function isPalindrome that takes a string as input and returns true if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and false otherwise.

5)Create a function countWords that takes a string and returns the number of words in that string. Words are separated by spaces.
